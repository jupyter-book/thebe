# Basic example

You can [browse it online](https://nthiery.github.io/thebelab/example/).
To serve it locally instead, run:

    python -m http.server

and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

This example uses by default https://beta.mybinder.org as
computational backend, and fetches the thebelab javascript library
from the web. It can be configured to use kernels from a specific
notebook server and a local installation of thebelab.
