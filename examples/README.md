# Examples of use of ThebeLab

You can [browse them online](https://minrk.github.io/thebelab/example/).
To serve them locally instead, run:

    python -m http.server

and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Some of the examples use a small extension `thebe_status_field`
provided here; this extension may eventually be moved into the main
`ThebeLab` library if there is popular request.
